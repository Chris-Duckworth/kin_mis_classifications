Galaxy position angle (PA) measurements and velocity field classifications ([MaNGA](https://www.sdss.org/surveys/manga/)).

This directory finds the PA (i.e. projected rotational direction) of stellar and ionized gas velocity fields for galaxies in MaNGA. Every velocity field for each galaxy (up-to the 8th MaNGA product launch; MPL-8) is given an expert classification (by eye) to determine its reliability/usability. This classification set is used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN), for quick classifications of velocity fields in future data releases (and potentially future surveys).
