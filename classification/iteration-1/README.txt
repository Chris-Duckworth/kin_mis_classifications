These files concern the first iteration of classifications for MPL-8 velocity fields.

Bugs: 

There is the odd galaxy classified with non 0-6.
The last ~50 galaxies are unclassified due to the dataframe not being updated on the last iteration.
~30 logged mistakes due to wrong key press.

To do (in iteration 2):

Classify last ~50 galaxies of MPL-8.
Update mistakes.

To do (in future iterations):

Classify 2 (clean/messy stellar but undefined halpha) into sub-categories (messy, clean stellar, dipsersion dom, central depletion, few vor bins?)
Classify 6 (funky) into sub-categories (merger, undefined stel rotation but stable gas?)
Classify 4 and 5 (kdcs and warped) into sub-categories. (actual KDC, just in stellar etc)
