This iteration concerns splitting the rough classifications into finer catagories.

To do:

Classify sub-category of messy maps due to voronoi bins and inclination likely biasing the fit.
Classify 2 (clean/messy stellar but undefined halpha) into sub-categories (messy, clean stellar, dipsersion dominated)
Classify 6 (funky) into sub-categories (merger, undefined stel rotation but stable gas?)
Classify 4 and 5 (kdcs and warped) into sub-categories. (actual KDC, just in stellar etc)
